            <h1> Site Navigation</h1>
            Easier navigation of a website is very important and in this case the site is actually quite simple for anyone to browse.  It does have a well highlighted menu structure on top of the page which when a user hover over some would bring up a drop down menu which can take them to other pages on the website. Search bar to enhance the efficiency of the website and makes it easier for more people to just navigate the site to exactly what they want to see which makes it easier and more efficient for most users who have lots of other things to do. There is a bit of scrolling on the site but it’s very manageable in most cases and really doesn’t affect much in terms for user navigation because comparing it other website it’s just a few centimetres scroll and you will be will able to read/see all the content on the site.

            <h1> Use of cookies</h1>
              Yes like most of the internet now they also use cookies on the site to mainly get their users preferences and be able to provide tailor information to them which they would require more and enhance their time whilst browsing the actual website. The use of cookies is also good for their business as well because it allows them to be able to do some analytical work/performances of the website and gather different trends of which customers are doing whilst online. For example they could actually see that the demand for home tickets is way bigger than when the team is playing away so with that they could come up to conclusion based on their analysis and try to advertise/promote the away tickets more so more supporters can see the details and be able then to buy tickets in the future.
