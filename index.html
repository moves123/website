            <h1> The Value of internet </h1>
            The development of the internet has been immense for the past decade or so and it has become so popular amongst the population top the point of which most of us aren’t able to even live with the thought of not being able to be connected to the world wide web.
People’s lives are drastically changing with the development of the internet as well; it’s now making it easier for people to access things quite fast and in the comfort of their own homes. E-commerce has generally benefited as well with the growth of the internet and now online shopping has become the best option for most users as it is easier and removes extra costs like travelling and searching around the shops to find the product you require.
It also bringing changes to most high street traders as well because they are now trying to focus more on the online side of the business side as it is bringing much more revenue and also could argue its way cheaper to manage because of the less overhead charges they have to consider for example like employing people, insurances needed for business, water and electric bills etc…

            <h1> Manchester United</h1>
            The website I have decided to study is “https://www.manutd.com/ ”.  The site is mainly a football club website which belongs to the team Manchester United and on there they have a club shop which their supporters can be able to access and buy club related products for example like the club kits, footballs, shoes and many others.
            It is mainly aimed for those people that support Manchester United and are around from the age of 12 and over. This is for so they can be able to keep up with some official news about the club and get the most up to date information rather than rumours from other sources.
<br>
<br>
            The site works very well, it is well designed and easy to use which is very vital for the purposes it was created so users can be able to browse the site with ease and find whatever they are looking for on the site. They have nice and well labelled menu with a drop down boxes which users can click and take them to different parts of the website. A search bar option is included as well which makes the navigation even more efficient.

            Manchester  united  themselves have benefited from the use of the internet as well each year they are posting improved revenue each quarter which shows the business is booming. In the fourth quarter Manchester united posted revenue of £590 Million which was up by 20% from the revenue they got from previous quarter. With further analysis it showed most of the business transaction was done online and third of the total income actually came by means of online sales.

            <h1>Method</h1>
            <p> The information I’m going to get for this report is mainly going to be from my actual user experience of accessing and using their website and viewing the sites resources. Will be using numerous devices to judge how the website responds to different devices and also going to investigate the front end and some assumptions of how maybe the code would run in the back end as well. </p>
