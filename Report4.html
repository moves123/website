            <h1> How secure is the site? </h1>
            The website in question is very secure and takes the security of their customers/members as a priority. Since they have joined the internet business model they haven’t had any problems with cyber criminals targeting them and leaking user’s information.
            As the internet is growing they are also keeping up with the new improved features to protect their users as well for instance they use SSL Certificate on their site and by doing this its makes it more secure for customers  because it allows a secure connection between the user browser and web server. With that it makes it secure for customers to login to the site and buy things online using their cards knowing their details are protected.
<br>
<br>
             Also with SSL certificate it makes it easier to distinguish a real website from a fake one which is vital for their customers because there are lots of phishing attempts online.
            They are also very strict on their password use on the site. They make all their users to create a very long and obscure password that would hard to guess. Every password on the site should be over 8 characters long, have special symbols in them like for example “@£$%&”, A capital letter character and finally a digit in there which makes the password more secure and more or less difficult to crack or guess.

            <h1> Technologies used to make site dynamic</h1>
            •	They in cooperate a menu that includes a drop down box which makes the site more dynamic and also very easy to navigate. This allows user in few clicks to browse the website and get to what they want straight away rather than click as many links before they get to the actual content that they want to view.

<br>
•	Another method used is the impimantation of JavaScript on the website. This allows them to have dynamic content running on the website and the good thing about all that is it going to be mainly at the client side so when a customer request the website all the dynamic bits are going to be executed with the html coding as well and that saves Manchester United the need of having the dynamic content stored in a server waiting when a customer request it.
<br>
•	The use of PHP is very important as well because it manages to keep the entire site coding behind the scenes/back end meaning the webpage’s are going to be able to load up much faster than ever. With a website like Manchester united they have so much content meaning also more code and if it weren’t for PHP then it would have been a drawback for them as the site would not have been very efficient and would take quite a long time for it to load up.
<br>
•	CSS is another mechanism which is pretty useful for the site. It’s important to have a well designed site that customers can be able to access and by using CSS Manchester United are able to implement different styles like shades of different colours, pictures matching the text on the site and generally and well decorated site for anyone to view.

            <h1>Devices</h1>
            <p> The website is designed to support the use of PC’s and smart phones. So depending on whichever device is being used the website is able to actually detect the device and scale so it can fit that device screen.
The following code extracted from their official website highlight the point in which they are able to cater for all their customers’ needs by having different devices supported because in the modern day we live in now few people are actually using PC’S / laptops on a daily basis so the use of Smartphone’s has developed and that’s where the target audience is mainly at and catering for that market will be good for business.
