            <h1> Internet connection </h1>
            For better  browsing the site does need a quite fast and reliable internet connection because it contains  quite a lot of dynamic information like pictures, videos and even drop down menus which requires internet to load and without a good connection the performance of the site would also be below par.
            However with that the site doesn’t assume everyone has a fast connection and just loads up every page as it normally does. If your connection is taking some time to load up a page then a run time error will pop out informing you what the problem was.

          </p>

            <h1> Assumptions of what goes on at the back end</h1>
            Manchester united site use an https connection which makes the site more secure. We can see this by viewing the actual source code of the Manchester united official website. From that I found out that they actually use xml which is an extensible mark-up language and that is well linked with the actual html language.
            They use external resources within the website so an example of this is their use of images, videos style sheet and many other this shows the site links other materials from different sources.
            They have SQL databases embedded within the website which contains quite lot of information about the club shop. All the stocks available for sale through the club are inputted into the database and that makes it easier for people working behind this to manage all the information and be able to actually update the website as soon as possible.

            <h1>What problems exist with the user experience on the site? </h1>
            <p>There isn’t much problems with the site but one problem which I noticed quite a lot when browsing the site was the amount of scrolling up and down I had to do and on one of the page it had a bit of side scrolling as well which really could distract other people from using the site because information overload. Most users don’t like reading a lot of information so this would make the user question if it’s actually necessary for them to use the website if it is actually making them reading a lot.
